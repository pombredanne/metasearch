Much of his message has reached an even broader audience outside of his mega-church through his best-selling faith-based book The Purpose-Driven Life.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn December 2008, Barack Obama chose Mr. Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration, making the pastor a lightning rod for controversy because of his outspoken opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. Although the choice was meant as an olive branch to conservative Christian evangelicals, it was criticized by gay rights groups, who were angered over Mr. Warren's support for California&#8217",
